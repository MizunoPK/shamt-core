  Child-side framework pull for the v2 master/child sync. Wraps .shamt-core/
  import-shamt.sh: reads master_url from .shamt-core/shamt-config.json (git URL or local
  path), pulls master HEAD, overwrites canonical sources under <child>/
  .shamt-core/ from master's sync set, auto-moves child-local proposals whose
  slugs match master's proposals/archive/ into .shamt-core/proposals/already-merged/, and
  re-runs regenerate-framework.sh so <child>/.claude/ stays current. Reports
  new / updated / unchanged / preserved counts plus any preserved-unmanaged or
  jq-missing warnings. Always-latest (no version pinning) per INFRASTRUCTURE.md
  §4.13. Invoke when the user wants to pull master updates, sync the framework,
  upgrade shamt in this project, refresh canonical sources, or run import-shamt.

## Overview

Mirrors the `/sync-import-shamt` slash command. Same canonical body, two host wirings.

## Protocol

Follow the canonical `/sync-import-shamt` command body verbatim — see [`commands/sync-import-shamt.md`](../../commands/sync-import-shamt.md). Summary:

1. **Resolve script** — `.shamt-core/import-shamt.sh` must exist under the cwd and be executable; if not, halt.
2. **Working tree check** — if the target is a git repo and `.shamt-core/` or `.claude/` has uncommitted changes, ask via `AskUserQuestion`: commit-first / proceed-anyway / cancel. Skip the check on non-git targets.
3. **Run** `bash .shamt-core/import-shamt.sh [--target {target_dir}]`. The script handles the clone (git URL) or local-copy (filesystem path), syncs master's sync set with overwrite, preserves local non-sync-set files (warn), auto-moves already-merged proposals, and runs regen at the end.
4. **Surface results** — the script logs per-file lines only for *new* and *updated* paths (not unchanged) and prints its own end-of-run structured summary (new / updated / unchanged / preserved / proposals-moved). Reproduce the summary verbatim in chat, then list each `WARN: preserving local file not in master sync set: …` and each `moved .shamt-core/proposals/{slug}.md → .shamt-core/proposals/already-merged/…` line so the user can act on each.
5. **Surface regen output** — apply the same surface rules as `/f4-regen-framework` for `wrote` / `removed` / `unchanged` / `WARN:` lines.
6. **Suggest follow-ups** — `git diff` review, optional `/f4-regen-framework` for an independent drift check, optional `/f5-audit-framework` for a deeper post-import sweep.

## Recommended model

Cheap (Haiku) — script wrapper, output parsing, no design. See [`reference/model_selection.md`](../../../../../reference/model_selection.md).

## Exit criteria

`import-shamt.sh` exited 0; counts surfaced; regen ran (or its absence was called out); the user knows how to review the diff.

## Footer contract (Phase 9 pragmatic rule)

Subtree-level, not per-file. Every path in master's sync set (`CLAUDE.md`, `CHEATSHEET.md`, `shamt-config.example.json`, `init-shamt.sh`, `import-shamt.sh`, `proposals/_template.md`, `scripts/`, `templates/`, `reference/`, `host/`) is master-owned and overwritten on import. Files the child adds under `.shamt-core/{templates,reference,host,scripts}/` outside that set are preserved with a warning. This is the practical interpretation of INFRASTRUCTURE.md §4.7, justified in `commands/sync-import-shamt.md` Notes.

## Why no reverse direction

This skill only pulls. To send a proposal upstream, use `/sync-submit-proposal {slug}` — manual copy per §4.3.
