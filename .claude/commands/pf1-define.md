description: Phase 3 of the PO flow — flesh out a feature (stub from /pe2-decompose, standalone, or tracker-seeded) into a feature.md ready for /validate-artifact
---

# /pf1-define

**Purpose:** Run Phase 3 of the PO flow at the **Feature** altitude. Resolve a slug, branch on three input modes (flesh out an existing stub written by `/pe2-decompose`, create a standalone feature from scratch, or seed from a tracker work-item payload), drive an open-questions iterative dialog over `Goal`, `Success Criteria`, and `Scope / Non-Scope`, and produce the feature under its parent epic — `epics/{epic-folder}/features/{ID}-{slug}-{brief}/feature.md` (the parent epic is the stub's epic, or the Tech Stories epic for standalone work). Leaves `Target Stories` and `Sequencing & Parallelization` empty — `/pf2-decompose` fills them later.

**Recommended model:** Reasoning (Opus). Feature drafting is a design / multi-dimensional scoping task — same justification as `/pe1-define`. See [`reference/model_selection.md`](../../../../reference/model_selection.md).

---

## Usage

```
/pf1-define {slug} [--tracker={ado|github|local}]
```

## Arguments

- `{slug}` (required) — feature slug. **Globally unique across the tree** (see §PO-tree resolution). Form depends on the active tracker profile:
  - **ado** — leading-numeric (`5102-payments-rewrite`) so the slug can resolve to a Feature work-item ID.
  - **github / local / none** — any descriptive kebab-case slug; resolved by folder glob.
- `--tracker={ado|github|local}` (optional) — one-off override of the project's default `work_item_tracker` for this invocation only. Same semantics as `/e1-start-story` and `/pe1-define`. Legal values: any profile file in [`reference/trackers/`](../../../../reference/trackers/). The default comes from `.shamt-core/shamt-config.json`. Per [`reference/trackers/_contract.md`](../../../../reference/trackers/_contract.md).
  - **Note:** the override only changes behavior in **Mode C** (where a tracker fetch actually happens). In **Mode A** (fleshing an existing stub) and **Mode B** (standalone from scratch), no fetch occurs and `--tracker=` is a no-op. Surface a one-line notice (`--tracker={name} is a no-op in Mode {A|B} — no tracker fetch occurs`) if the flag is passed in those modes so the user is not surprised.

## Prerequisites

- `.shamt-core/shamt-config.json` must exist at the project root. If not, halt and direct the user to `init-shamt`.
- If `--tracker=` is passed, the named profile must exist at `reference/trackers/{name}.md`. If not, halt and list the available profiles.

## Step-by-step

### Step 1 — Read configuration

1. Read `.shamt-core/shamt-config.json` from the project root. Extract `work_item_tracker` (one of `ado`, `github`, `local`, `none`).
2. If the user passed `--tracker={name}`, override the value for this invocation.
3. Read the corresponding profile at `reference/trackers/{name}.md` (skip when the resolved value is `none` — see Step 4 fallthrough).

### Step 2 — Resolve the slug to a feature folder

Apply the global slug-resolution rule from [`SHAMT_RULES.template.md`](../../../../templates/SHAMT_RULES.template.md) (Principle 1) — resolve per `templates/SHAMT_RULES.template.md` §PO-tree resolution. Slugs are globally unique, so the resolved folder's altitude is unambiguous.

**Altitude dispatch (own vs. parent vs. neither).** Resolve the slug and branch on the altitude of the folder it resolves to:

- **Own altitude (the slug resolves to a *feature* folder)** → the single-feature behavior below (the rest of Step 2 and the Step-by-step) runs **unchanged**. This is the default, by-far-common case.
- **Parent altitude (the slug resolves to an *epic* folder)** → enter **[Parent-slug batch mode](#parent-slug-batch-mode-epic--all-features)**: define every feature under that epic, sequentially. Hand off to that section and do not run the single-feature steps directly.
- **Neither (the slug resolves to no feature and no epic, or to a story)** → halt and report `slug {slug} resolves to neither a feature (own altitude) nor an epic (parent altitude) — nothing to define`.

The single-feature resolution that follows runs only on the own-altitude branch:

1. Glob the nested feature path: `epics/*/features/{ID}-*/feature.md` (for a ticket ID) or, for a slug, **both** `epics/*/features/{slug}-*/feature.md` and `epics/*/features/*-{slug}-*/feature.md` (tree-wide feature glob). Also check the legacy-flat fallback: `features/{ID}-*/feature.md`, `features/{slug}-*/feature.md`, or `features/*-{slug}-*/feature.md` (for backwards compatibility with flat-layout features).
2. If any match is found, verify it is the only one; if multiple matches exist for the same slug, halt and ask the user which folder to use.
3. **Multiple matches** → halt and ask the user which folder to use.
4. **One match** → that folder is the feature folder. **Detect Mode A vs. re-entry** by inspecting `feature.md`:
   - If `feature.md` has its **decomposition-authored fields** filled — `**Ticket ID:** T{N}` + `## Goal`, plus (on a richer-cataloging stub) `## Scope / Non-Scope` + `## Decomposition Context` — but the **depth sections `## Success Criteria` and `## Open Questions` are still empty** (per the `/pe2-decompose` Step 8 contract), this is a **stub** — proceed to **Mode A** under Step 4. (The parent epic is the folder path.)
   - If `feature.md` has its **depth sections drafted** (`## Success Criteria` / `## Open Questions` populated — a prior `/pf1-define` deep-dive ran), this is a **re-entry**. Confirm with the user how to proceed. **Available options depend on whether the active tracker actually has a Feature fetch path** (resolved in Step 1 plus the profile's `## Supported work-item types`):
     - **Fetching profile that declares Feature support** (e.g., `ado`): offer all four — **refetch**, **overwrite**, **extend**, **exit**.
     - **Fetching profile that does *not* declare Feature support** (e.g., `github`): same options as `local` / `none` — **overwrite**, **extend**, **exit**. Refetch is suppressed because the profile would just fall through to freeform anyway (per the freeform-fallback rule), making the offered branch pointless.
     - **`local`:** the file is the source of truth. Offer **overwrite**, **extend**, **exit**.
     - **`none`:** no tracker fetch path. Offer **overwrite**, **extend**, **exit**.

     Footer handling per branch (same rules as `/pe1-define`):
     - **Refetch** (offered only when the active profile declares Feature support) — re-run the tracker fetch (Step 4 Mode C) and re-author the artifact from scratch. The file is rewritten wholesale; any prior `Validated …` footer is discarded along with the prior content. `/validate-artifact` must re-run. **Note:** if the existing artifact was originally drafted via Mode A (stub-fleshing) or Mode B (standalone), Refetch will replace that hand-authored content with tracker-seeded content — surface a one-line warning (`current artifact was not tracker-seeded — Refetch will replace hand-authored content with tracker payload`) before proceeding so the user can opt for Extend instead.
     - **Overwrite** — start the freeform open-questions dialog (Step 6) from a fresh template. Same wholesale rewrite; prior footer discarded.
     - **Extend** — preserve existing content and add to it. **If a prior `Validated …` footer is present, strip it before continuing** — extension changes the artifact and invalidates the prior pass; `/validate-artifact` must re-run.
     - **Exit** — leave the file untouched and return. No footer change.

     **Preserve the `**Ticket ID:**` header verbatim on re-entry.** The `**Ticket ID:** …` line is never rewritten by `/pf1-define` regardless of the chosen branch — it is decomposition-owned per the decomposition step. Only the body sections are touched. (Parentage is the folder path.)
5. **Zero matches** → continue to Step 3 (Mode B or Mode C, decided in Step 4).

### Step 3 — Derive the brief description and propose the folder name

Applies only when the slug does not yet resolve to a folder (i.e., Mode A is ruled out and we are heading into Mode B or Mode C):

1. Ask the user for a 2–4-word **brief description** of the feature, or derive it from the tracker payload's title once fetched (re-propose after Step 4 Mode C).
2. **For a new (non-stub) feature, allocate a ticket ID** `T{N}` (= `max` of the `^T([0-9]+)-` prefixes across `epics/`, `features/`, `stories/`, + 1 — per **# Ticket IDs**) and propose `epics/{epic-folder}/features/{ID}-{slug}-{brief-description-kebab}/`, populating the `**Ticket ID:** T{N}` header. **Mode A (stub):** the folder + its ID already exist — reuse them, do **not** allocate or re-propose. Ask the user to confirm before creating directories. Lowercase, hyphen-separated.
3. On confirmation, create the folder.

### Step 4 — Branch on input mode

The command supports three input modes. **Mode disambiguation order:**

1. **Mode A — flesh out an existing stub** if Step 2 resolved to a folder whose `feature.md` matches the stub shape (decomposition-authored fields filled — Goal one-liner, plus `## Scope / Non-Scope` + `## Decomposition Context` on a richer-cataloging stub — but the depth sections `## Success Criteria` / `## Open Questions` still empty; parentage is the folder path).
   - **Stage-0 draft variant of Mode A.** A `feature.md` written by `/pf0-draft` is the same shape (populated `## Goal`, depth sections empty) **plus** a stage-0 draft marker — a `**Status:** Draft (f0 — feature-idea capture, unrefined)` header line and a `## Scratch Notes (stage-0 capture)` section. Detect the marker; when present, this is the **draft-ingest** sub-case of Mode A (handled below). When absent, it is the ordinary decompose-stub Mode A. Either way Mode A wins the disambiguation; the marker only selects the sub-case.
2. **Mode C — tracker-seeded** if Mode A did not apply AND the active tracker profile declares Feature work-item type support AND the slug parses to a tracker ID per the profile's `## Slug resolution` rule.
3. **Mode B — standalone from scratch** otherwise.

#### Mode A — flesh out an existing stub (the common case after `/pe2-decompose`)

The folder exists; `feature.md` already carries a populated `## Goal` from `/pe2-decompose` Step 8 — and, for a stub created under richer-cataloging decomposition, a populated `## Scope / Non-Scope` boundary and a `## Decomposition Context` section. (The parent epic is the folder path.)

**Stage-0 draft ingest.** If the resolved `feature.md` carries the `/pf0-draft` stage-0 draft marker (`**Status:** Draft (f0 — feature-idea capture, unrefined)` + a `## Scratch Notes (stage-0 capture)` section), **ingest the draft** the way `/f1-propose-update` ingests an f0 draft: seed the open-questions dialog (Step 6) from the captured `## Scratch Notes (stage-0 capture)` content (and the populated `## Goal`), then **strip both the `**Status:** Draft (f0 …)` marker line and the entire `## Scratch Notes (stage-0 capture)` section on completion** so the finished `feature.md` carries no draft residue. When the marker is **absent** (an ordinary `/pf2-decompose` stub or an older stub), the existing seed-from-`## Decomposition Context` / bare-stub path below is unchanged.

1. **Preserve the `## Goal` verbatim.** Do not rewrite it.
2. **Consume the stub's `## Decomposition Context` as a research seed when present** — a stub created before #12 (or via a path that didn't catalog it) lacks the section, so fall back to the existing `## Goal` alone (and `## Scope / Non-Scope` if it was already populated), with no failure. Then proceed to Step 5 (architecture consult) and Step 6 (open-questions dialog) to populate `Success Criteria` + `Open Questions` and the `## Scope / Non-Scope` boundary — **deepening** it when decomposition pre-populated it (a richer-cataloging stub), or **populating it from scratch** when it is empty (an older stub). The existing `/validate-artifact` handoff at the end of the command is unchanged; validation is not folded in here.
3. Leave `Target Stories` and `Sequencing & Parallelization` empty — those are `/pf2-decompose`'s output.
4. **No `## All Remaining Fields` appendix** — there was no tracker fetch in this mode.

#### Mode B — create a standalone feature from scratch

The folder did not exist before Step 3. There is no explicit parent epic input from the user.

1. Write `epics/{epic-folder}/features/{ID}-{slug}-{brief}/feature.md` from [`templates/feature.template.md`](../../../../templates/feature.template.md). After writing feature.md, write its path to `shamt-state/active-feature` (and `shamt-state/active-epic` for its parent epic when nested).
2. **Mode B has no top-level home** — a standalone feature is created under the standing Tech Stories epic (`epics/{epic-folder}/features/{ID}-{slug}-{brief}/feature.md` (here `{epic-folder}` = the Tech Stories epic), per #15). There is no blank-parent / top-level feature. (If #15 has not landed alongside, the executor halts per the index's sequencing precondition.)
3. Proceed to Step 5 (architecture consult), then Step 6 (open-questions dialog) to populate `Goal`, `Success Criteria`, and `Scope / Non-Scope` from scratch.
4. Leave `Target Stories` and `Sequencing & Parallelization` empty.
5. **No `## All Remaining Fields` appendix** — there was no tracker fetch in this mode.

#### Mode C — tracker-seeded

The slug parses to a tracker work-item ID and the active profile declares Feature support.

##### C.1 — Slug-to-ID parse

Apply the profile's `## Slug resolution` rule. If the slug does not parse to a tracker ID (e.g., no leading numeric segment on ADO, or the slug is descriptive-only on a profile that requires IDs), surface a one-line notice — `slug {slug} does not match {profile}'s ID form — proceeding freeform` — and **fall through to Mode B** (Step 4 Mode B sub-step 1).

##### C.2 — Profile-driven fetch

1. Check `## Supported work-item types` in the active profile. `/pf1-define` requires **Feature** (or `Any`). If the profile does not declare `Feature` support, surface the **freeform-fallback notice** — instantiate the contract template from [`reference/trackers/_contract.md`](../../../../reference/trackers/_contract.md) freeform-fallback rule (`tracker profile <name> has no <Type> work-item type — proceeding freeform`) with `<Type>` = `Feature` and `<name>` = the active profile's filename stem, yielding: `tracker profile {name} has no Feature work-item type — proceeding freeform`. **Fall through:** if Step 2 resolved to a stub, fall through to **Mode A**; otherwise fall through to **Mode B**.
   - GitHub currently has **no** Feature type — `/pf1-define` against the GitHub profile always falls through here.
   - ADO supports Feature natively (`System.WorkItemType = "Feature"`) — fetch proceeds.
2. Run the profile's `## Primary fetch` command, substituting `{id}` from sub-step C.1.
3. **Do not write `raw/issue.json`.** Feature folders contain **only** `feature.md` — no `raw/` subfolder, no `feedback/`. Hold the payload in memory while populating the artifact; the fetched JSON is not persisted to disk. **Same rule as `/pe1-define`** — distinct from stories, which *do* have `raw/`.
4. Apply the profile's `## Field mapping` to populate the corresponding sections of [`templates/feature.template.md`](../../../../templates/feature.template.md):
   - **Title / Type / State / Assignee / Project / Iteration/Milestone** → used to seed the H1 line and to inform the agent (not their own section in `feature.template.md`; record them in the **All Remaining Fields** appendix described in sub-step C.5).
   - **Description** → narrative input for the `Goal` section; the agent rewrites it as "what this feature exists to accomplish" rather than verbatim paste.
   - **Acceptance Criteria** → seed for `Success Criteria` bullets.
   - **Parent work-item link** (when the profile surfaces a parent Epic relation) → the parent work-item link determines the feature's nesting parent — create the feature under the matched local epic folder when the parent's slug resolves to one under `epics/`, else under the Tech Stories epic (#15). No back-ref header is written (parentage is the folder path, C3).
   - Apply the markdown normalization rules from [`templates/ticket.ado.template.md`](../../../../templates/ticket.ado.template.md) / [`templates/ticket.github.template.md`](../../../../templates/ticket.github.template.md) (entity decoding, attribute stripping, U+FFFD preservation, long-field rendering).
5. **All Remaining Fields appendix.** Any non-empty payload fields the agent wants to preserve for fidelity (custom fields, long design notes, attachment URLs, etc.) go into a final `## All Remaining Fields` subsection appended **immediately above the validation footer slot** (i.e., below `Sequencing & Parallelization`). Same pattern as `/pe1-define` — no `raw/` subfolder. Omit the subsection entirely when there is nothing worth preserving.
6. Detect `## Auth failure modes` patterns. If the primary fetch fails on auth, surface the profile's fallback notice and **fall through to Mode B** (or Mode A if Step 2 resolved to a stub).
7. After populating the seed content, write its path to `shamt-state/active-feature` (and `shamt-state/active-epic` for its parent epic when nested). Then proceed to Step 5 (architecture consult) and Step 6 (open-questions dialog) to fill any gaps the tracker payload does not cover.

### Step 5 — Consult `.shamt-core/project-specific-files/ARCHITECTURE.md` (advisory)

Thread architecture / coding-standards consultation at the PO altitude as follows:

1. Read `.shamt-core/project-specific-files/ARCHITECTURE.md` (project root) while drafting. **If the file does not exist**, note its absence in chat (a single line: `.shamt-core/project-specific-files/ARCHITECTURE.md not found — proceeding without architecture consult; bootstrap via init-shamt is the canonical fix.`) and continue. Do **not** halt — `.shamt-core/project-specific-files/ARCHITECTURE.md` is governing when present (per the SHAMT_RULES Standards check invariant) but the feature-altitude consult is advisory; missing the file degrades the consult, not the command. Per the SHAMT_RULES Global Story Invariants "Standards check" rule.
2. If the feature implies architectural change — a new service, a new boundary, a new data store, a new external integration, an auth/tenant boundary shift, etc. — flag it **inline** in `Scope / Non-Scope` as a single line at the top of that section: `**Architecture impact:** {one-line description of the architectural change implied}`. Omit the flag entirely when no architectural change is implied (or when `.shamt-core/project-specific-files/ARCHITECTURE.md` is absent and the impact cannot be assessed against a baseline — note the same in chat).
3. **Do not consult `.shamt-core/project-specific-files/CODING_STANDARDS.md`** — coding style is irrelevant at the feature altitude. The story-altitude Phase 2 / Phase 6 / Phase 7 cycle handles coding-standards alignment for any code changes the feature eventually produces. Same rule as `/pe1-define`.

### Step 6 — Open-questions iterative dialog

Apply [`SHAMT_RULES.template.md`](../../../../templates/SHAMT_RULES.template.md) Principle 2:

1. Maintain the `## Open Questions` section as you draft. Add a checkbox-prefixed entry the moment a question surfaces.
2. Surface each question to the user **one at a time** via `AskUserQuestion` (or equivalent). Never bulk-bomb.
3. Update the feature with each answer **before** moving to the next question. The artifact is not "drafted" while `## Open Questions` is non-empty.
4. Never proceed on a silent assumption. If an answer changes `Goal`, edit it (Mode B and Mode C only — Mode A's Goal is preserved per Step 4 Mode A sub-step 1). If it changes `Success Criteria`, edit them. If it changes `Scope / Non-Scope`, edit it (including the `**Architecture impact:** …` flag).
5. **Do not populate `Target Stories` or `Sequencing & Parallelization`** in this command. Those sections are owned by `/pf2-decompose`; leave them present-but-empty per the template.

### Step 7 — Detect slug collisions

After writing the folder and feature:

1. Glob `features/{ID}-*/` (for a ticket ID) or, for a slug, **both** `features/{slug}-*/` and `features/*-{slug}-*/` (and the exact `features/{slug}/`), and confirm only one folder exists for this feature.
2. If multiple folders exist (typically because a different brief was used previously), halt and ask the user to either reuse the existing folder or rename one. Feature slugs are **globally unique**.

### Step 8 — Exit gate

Verify before exiting:

- [ ] `epics/{epic-folder}/features/{ID}-{slug}-{brief}/feature.md` exists and is non-empty (nested).
- [ ] `## Open Questions` is empty (every question resolved, with answers folded into the artifact).
- [ ] `Goal`, `Success Criteria`, and `Scope / Non-Scope` are drafted.
- [ ] `Target Stories` and `Sequencing & Parallelization` are **left empty** (owned by `/pf2-decompose`).
- [ ] **Mode A:** the original `## Goal` one-liner from the stub is preserved verbatim.
- [ ] **Mode B:** created under the Tech Stories epic (per #15).
- [ ] **Mode C:** `## All Remaining Fields` appendix is present iff the fetched payload had non-empty fields worth preserving.
- [ ] `shamt-state/active-feature` and `shamt-state/active-epic` pointers have been written.
- [ ] No `Validated …` footer present yet — `/validate-artifact` appends it.
- [ ] User has confirmed the slug + content.

If any item fails, return to the relevant step.

### Step 9 — Suggest the next command

Surface — but do **not** auto-invoke — the next command:

```
/clear
/validate-artifact epics/{epic-folder}/features/{ID}-{slug}-{brief}/feature.md
```

After validation appends the footer, `/pf2-decompose {slug}` can run. This command stays independently runnable by a fresh agent off on-disk state per Principle 1 — chaining validation here would couple the two phases.

## Parent-slug batch mode (epic → all features)

Entered from Step 2's altitude dispatch when the slug resolves to an **epic** folder (the parent altitude) rather than a feature folder. The command then runs its own single-feature define logic across every feature under that epic, sequentially. This is **horizontal sibling fan-out at one altitude** — it defines each feature; it does **not** decompose them (that stays `/pf2-decompose`) and does **not** chain into any other altitude's command. The batch loop is a **stateless, disk-derived dispatcher of this command's own single-feature logic** — the worklist comes from the epic's on-disk decomposition output, and re-invocation is resumable (see Principle 1 reconciliation in Notes).

1. **Derive the ordered worklist from disk.** Read the epic's `epic.md` and take its child features in the order given by `## Sequencing & Parallelization` (`Recommended order`), falling back to `## Target Features` list order when no sequencing is recorded. Resolve each listed slug to its feature folder per §PO-tree resolution.
   - **Empty / un-decomposed parent.** If the epic has no children (its `## Target Features` decomposition list is empty / absent — e.g. the epic has not yet been run through `/pe2-decompose`), the worklist is empty: report `parent {slug} has no children to process — run the decompose phase (/pe2-decompose {slug}) first` and **exit cleanly** (a no-op, distinct from the Step 2 "neither own nor parent altitude → halt" dispatch case).
2. **Skip-already-defined-with-notice (resumability).** For each feature in worklist order, first check whether it is already defined — its depth sections (`## Success Criteria` / `## Open Questions`) are drafted (the single-slug completion signal). If so, emit a one-line notice (`skipping {feature-slug} — already defined`) and move to the next child. This makes re-invocation resumable: a batch interrupted partway resumes at the first incomplete child without re-prompting completed ones.
3. **Per-child execution.** For each not-yet-defined feature, run this command's **single-feature** Step-by-step verbatim on that feature's slug — including the full per-child open-questions iterative dialog (Step 6), one question at a time per Principle 2. Each child runs its **own complete dialog before the next child starts**; never bulk-bomb the union of all children's questions across the batch.
4. **Halt-at-child on an unresolvable outcome.** If any child hits a condition it cannot resolve (slug collision, ambiguous resolution, a dialog that cannot converge), **stop the batch at that child** and surface its report verbatim. The user fixes it and re-invokes; resumability (step 2) resumes at that child without re-prompting the children already defined ahead of it.
5. **Final summary.** When the worklist is exhausted, report a one-line-per-child summary: each child slug and its outcome (`defined` / `skipped — already defined`), then the next-command suggestion (`/clear`, then `/validate-artifact` on each newly defined feature, or `/pf2-decompose {epic-slug}` to decompose them).

## Tracker integration

`/pf1-define` mirrors `/e1-start-story` and `/pe1-define`'s tracker plumbing at the Feature altitude. The active profile's `## Supported work-item types` section is authoritative — if it does not declare **Feature**, this command **falls through to freeform mode** with a one-line notice (the contract template instantiated at this altitude: `tracker profile {name} has no Feature work-item type — proceeding freeform`) and continues per Step 4 Mode A or Mode B (whichever applies given the filesystem state). Per the freeform-fallback rule in [`reference/trackers/_contract.md`](../../../../reference/trackers/_contract.md) (which defines the template generically as `tracker profile <name> has no <Type> work-item type — proceeding freeform`, instantiated here with `<Type>` = `Feature`). Do **not** silently fail; do **not** halt.

When the fetch succeeds, raw payload data is preserved inline in `feature.md`'s **All Remaining Fields** appendix (Step 4 Mode C, sub-step C.5) — there is no `raw/` subfolder at the feature altitude. Same pattern as `/pe1-define`.

## Exit criteria

- `epics/{epic-folder}/features/{ID}-{slug}-{brief}/feature.md` (nested) exists, is non-empty, and has `Goal`, `Success Criteria`, `Scope / Non-Scope` drafted.
- `Target Stories` and `Sequencing & Parallelization` remain empty (decomposition output).
- `## Open Questions` is empty.
- Parentage is the folder path; nesting is determined by the input mode: stub's parent (Mode A), Tech Stories epic (Mode B), or tracker-matched epic or Tech Stories (Mode C).
- No validation footer yet — `/validate-artifact` adds it.
- The user has confirmed slug + content; the next command has been suggested in chat.

## Notes

- **Fresh-agent runnable.** Every input lives on disk (`.shamt-core/shamt-config.json`, the tracker profile, `.shamt-core/project-specific-files/ARCHITECTURE.md`, the existing stub or prior draft when re-entering). No conversation history required.
- **Feature-level validation is `/validate-artifact`.** Features have no review phase — Pattern 1 validation only. The decomposition exit gate run inside `/pf2-decompose` is a stub-batch check on that command's output and is **distinct from `/validate-artifact`**; do not conflate.
- **No `Target Stories` work here.** This command writes the feature with the decomposition sections empty; `/pf2-decompose` fills them. Two reasons: keeps single-session sizing tight (Principle 1 — single-session sizing constraint), and keeps deep dialog at the right altitude per the stub-list-then-drill-in decomposition.
- **No `.shamt-core/project-specific-files/CODING_STANDARDS.md` consult.** Coding style is irrelevant at the feature altitude. Same rule as `/pe1-define`.
- **`--tracker=` is one-off, not persisted.** The project default in `.shamt-core/shamt-config.json` is unchanged. The override only affects Mode C; in Mode A and Mode B it is a no-op (a notice is surfaced when the flag is supplied in those modes).
- **The freeform-fallback rule** means future tracker profiles that don't declare `Feature` natively still work — `/pf1-define` degrades gracefully with a one-line notice and continues into Mode A or Mode B based on the filesystem state.
- **Mode disambiguation is filesystem-first.** Mode A wins when the stub is present; Mode C wins next when the tracker profile and slug shape align; Mode B is the default fallback. No new flags are needed to pick a mode.
- **Parent-slug batch mode is horizontal fan-out, not vertical chaining — and honors Principle 1.** Passing an **epic** slug (the parent altitude) runs this command's single-feature logic across every feature under the epic (`## Parent-slug batch mode`). This is **horizontal sibling fan-out at one altitude** — distinct from the vertical cross-altitude chaining the "No `/pf2-decompose` / Engineer-flow auto-invocation" discipline forbids: batch `/pf1-define` over an epic still does **not** decompose those features (that stays `/pf2-decompose`); it only runs the *same* define phase across siblings. It honors Principle 1 by the same argument `CLAUDE.md` homes for the `/f-all` / `/e-all` drivers: it is a **stateless, disk-derived dispatcher** of this command's own single-feature logic (worklist derived from the epic's on-disk `Target Features` / `Sequencing & Parallelization`, resumable by re-invocation via the skip-already-defined check, each child independently runnable via its own single slug) — not a state-holding mega-orchestrator.
